## Features

- A 3D cube at the center of the screen.
- The cube has a color gradient that goes from blue at the bottom to red at the top.
- The cube rotates on itself to create an animated effect.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository on your local machine or download the files as a ZIP archive.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. You will see the 3D cube at the center of the screen with the color gradient.

## How It Works

- The Three.js library is used to create a scene, a camera, and a renderer.
- A color gradient from blue to red is generated and applied to the cube.
- The cube is created using the `BoxGeometry` class from Three.js and the color gradient is assigned using custom vertex attributes and colors.
- The cube is added to the scene and rendered on the screen.

## Requirements

- A web browser that supports WebGL.
